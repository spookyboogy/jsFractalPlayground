- Make a minimal, toggle-able debug panel so that we can see canvas size vs viewport size vs drawing buffer size in real time

- create "auto" mode, which basically simulates clicking the triangle at optimal times to produce most interesting animation (ie after 5-6 iterations, calling a new updateCanvas)
